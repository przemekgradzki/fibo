NAICS was developed under the auspices of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and adopted in 1997 to replace the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. It was developed jointly by the U.S. Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), Statistics Canada and Mexico&apos;s Instituto Nacional Estadistica y Geografia, to allow for a high level of comparability in business statistics among the North American countries.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>

These codes were created by the U.S. government in 1937 to facilitate analysis of economic activity across government agencies and within industries. They were mostly replaced in 1997 by a new system of six-digit codes called the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The new codes were adopted in part to standardize industry data collection and analysis in between Canada, the United States and Mexico which had entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Note that certain organizations, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) still use SIC codes for some purposes.</fibo-fnd-utl-av:explanatoryNote>
